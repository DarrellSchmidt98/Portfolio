    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I started coding in highschool, so around 6 years ago. I taught 
    myself PHP and Python, using codecademy to start the learning proccess.
After a handful of projects in those I determined it would be best to learn some
other languages. I procceeded to learn HTML, CSS, and Java. Now I am attending school
online at Independence University learning Web Design. With the schooling
I am getting better knowledge of website 'best practices' on how to implement
my self-taught skills. </p>

and fantasy/scifi novels.</p>
